        >Sonic the Hedgehog is a Japanese video game series and media franchise
        created by Sega. The franchise follows Sonic, an anthropomorphic blue
        hedgehog who battles the evil Doctor Eggman, a mad scientist. The main
        Sonic the Hedgehog games are platformers mostly developed by Sonic Team;
        other games, developed by various studios, include spin-offs in the
        racing, fighting, party and sports genres. The franchise also
        incorporates printed media, animations, feature films, and
        merchandise.</marquee

        >By 1990, the Japanese video game company Sega wanted a foothold in the
        video game console market with its 16-bit console, the Sega Genesis.
        Sega's efforts had been stymied by the dominance of Nintendo; the
        Genesis did not have a large install base and Nintendo did not take Sega
        seriously as a competitor. Sega of America CEO Michael Katz attempted to
        challenge Nintendo with the "Genesis does what Nintendon't" marketing
        campaign and by collaborating with athletes and celebrities to create
        games. 405–406  These efforts did not break Nintendo's dominance, and
        Katz was replaced by Tom Kalinske, formerly of Mattel. 423–424  Sega
        president Hayao Nakayama decided Sega needed a flagship series and
        mascot to compete with Nintendo's Mario franchise. Nintendo had recently
        released Super Mario Bros. 3, at the time the bestselling video game
        ever. Sega's strategy had been based on porting its successful arcade
        games to the Genesis; however, Nakayama recognized that Sega needed a
        star character in a game that could demonstrate the power of the
        Genesis's hardware. An internal contest was held to determine a flagship
        game, with a focus on the American audience. Among the teams working on
        proposals were artist Naoto Ohshima and programmer Yuji
        Naka. 20–33, 96–101  The gameplay of Sonic the Hedgehog (1991)
        originated with a tech demo created by Naka, who had developed an
        algorithm that allowed a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by
        determining its position with a dot matrix. Naka's prototype was a
        platform game that involved a fast-moving character rolling in a ball
        through a long winding tube. Sega management accepted the duo's project
        and they were joined by designer Hirokazu Yasuhara. After Yasuhara
        joined Naka and Ohshima, their focus shifted to the protagonist, who
        Sega hoped could become its mascot. The protagonist was initially a
        rabbit able to grasp objects with prehensile ears, but the concept
        proved too complex for the hardware. The team moved on to animals that
        could roll into a ball, and eventually settled on Sonic, a teal hedgehog
        created by Ohshima. Naka's prototype was fleshed out with Ohshima's
        character design and levels conceived by Yasuhara. Sonic's color was
        chosen to match Sega's cobalt blue logo, and his red and white shoes
        were inspired by the cover of Michael Jackson's 1987 album Bad. His
        personality was based on Bill Clinton's "can-do" attitude. The
        antagonist, Doctor Eggman, was another character Ohshima had designed
        for the contest. The team thought the abandoned design was excellent and
        retooled the character into a villain. The team took the name Sonic Team
        for the game's release. Sonic's first appearance came in Sega AM3's
        racing game Rad Mobile (1991) five months before the release of Sonic
        the Hedgehog, as an ornament hanging from the driver's rearview mirror.
        The Sonic developers let AM3 use Sonic because they were interested in
        making the character visible to the public. Although Katz was certain
        that Sonic would not be popular with American children, new CEO Kalinske
        arranged to place Sonic the Hedgehog as the pack-in game with the
        Genesis. Featuring speedy gameplay, Sonic the Hedgehog received critical
        acclaim. It greatly increased the popularity of the Sega Genesis in
        North America, credited with helping Sega gain 65% of the market share
        against Nintendo. Naka was dissatisfied with his treatment at Sega and
        felt he received little credit for his involvement in the success. He
        quit but was hired by Mark Cerny to work at the US-based Sega Technical
        Institute (STI), with a higher salary and more creative freedom.
        Yasuhara also decided to move to STI. STI began work on Sonic the
        Hedgehog 2 (1992) in November 1991. Level artist Yasushi Yamaguchi
        designed Sonic's new sidekick, Tails, a flying two-tailed fox inspired
        by the mythological kitsune. Like its predecessor, Sonic the Hedgehog 2
        was a major success, but its development suffered from the language
        barrier and cultural differences between the Japanese and American
        developers. While STI developed Sonic 2, Ohshima led a team in Japan to
        create Sonic CD for the Genesis's CD-ROM accessory, the Sega CD; it was
        conceived as an enhanced port of Sonic 2, but evolved into a separate
        project. Once development on Sonic 2 concluded, Cerny departed and was
        replaced by Roger Hector. STI divided into two teams: the Japanese
        developers led by Naka, and the American developers. The Japanese began
        work on Sonic the Hedgehog 3. It was initially developed as an isometric
        game using the Sega Virtua Processor chip, but was restarted as a more
        conventional side-scrolling game after the chip was delayed. It
        introduced Sonic's rival Knuckles, created by artist Takashi Thomas
        Yuda. Due to an impending promotion with McDonald's and cartridges size
        constraints, the project was split in two: the first half, Sonic 3, was
        released in February 1994, and the second, Sonic & Knuckles, a few
        months later. The Sonic & Knuckles cartridge contains an adapter that
        allows players to connect it to Sonic 3, creating a combined game, Sonic
        3 & Knuckles. Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles, as with their predecessors,
        were acclaimed. To release a Sonic game in time for the 1993 holiday
        shopping season, Sega commissioned the American team to make a new game,
        the spin-off Sonic Spinball. While Spinball received poor reviews, it

        and the handheld Game Gear. The first, an 8-bit version of the original
        Sonic, was developed by Ancient to promote the Game Gear and released in
        December 1991. Aspect Co. developed most of the subsequent 8-bit Sonic
        games, beginning with a version of Sonic 2. Other Sonic games released

        Western localization of the Japanese puzzle game Puyo Puyo (1991),
        SegaSonic the Hedgehog (1993), an arcade game featuring isometric
        gameplay, and Knuckles' Chaotix (1995), a spin-off for the Genesis's 32X

          Yoshi is a dinosaur-like character that acts as an ally of Sonic and
          Tails. Among members of the Yoshi species hailing from Yoshi's Island,
          any Yoshi may be identified as the "Yoshi" character, and as such, not
          all iterations of the character are necessarily the same one. Yoshi
          was first introduced in Sonic Adventure 2 (1992) and was considered a
          smash hit.
